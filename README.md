# hello-world
First repository

Hi there! I'm a student at Brunel University London and I'm from Poland :)
I love new experiences, travels, adventures, books, phylosophy, new people, music, films, cooking and everything that is clearly and without any doubts good -if u know what i mean- and now I hope to become a master java programmer!
Cheers!

ps. i meant that these things really dont have any real bad sides, that is perfect platonic idea of good, mellow love juice straight from god
